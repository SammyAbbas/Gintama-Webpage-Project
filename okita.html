		</aside>

		<p>During his childhood, Sougo's parents passed away, leaving his older sister, Okita Mitsuba, to raise him by herself in their home village. She herself admits later that she spoiled him because of their parents' death, which caused him to be aloof and distant. Because of this, he never had many friends, until he caught the eye of Kondou Isao who took him in as a trainee into his dojo. He grew fond of Kondou and still highly respects him.</p>

		<p>However, after a new student, Hijikata Toushirou joined the dojo, Sougo became more distant, feeling that Hijikata was taking over Kondo's attention and favouring Hijikata over him. Sougo noticed that Hijikata had grown a close friendship with Kondou and Mitsuba, and this (accompanied by his arrogant attitude at the dojo) caused Sougo to hate Hijikata with a great passion.</p>

		<p>A few years later, Sougo, along with the other Dojo students, set off for Edo and subsequently set up the Shinsengumi. Okita Mitsuba wanted to go with Sougo to watch over him and to be with Hijikata. However, after Hijikata rejected Mitsuba's request to follow him (out of knowledge that the path he chose could cause him to lose his life at any time), Sougo has held a grudge against him. This grudge is additionally fueled by his goal to take over as vice-commander of the Shinsengumi.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Appearance</h2>
		<hr></hr>

		<p>Okita Sougo appears to be a mild-featured young man with short, light brown hair and red-brown eyes. He has an almost-childlike innocent face as well as full lips and is often described as handsome. During the Correspondance arc, his picture is used to create the impression that 'Shinpachi' is attractive, and at one point, it is said that his good looks are all he has.</p>

		<p>He wears the standard Shinsengumi uniform. Like all Shinsengumi captains, he wears a white cravat around his neck, tucked into a black vest with a yellow lock. His dark, unbuttoned jacket (reaching to the thigh with a collar) is decorated with gold buckles, buttons, and triangular-shaped cuffs. His black trousers are supported by a brown belt with a silver buckle. At the left hip is tied his sheath, holding his katana. He also wears black, heavy boots with a small heel.</p>

		<p>When resting, or skipping work, he wears a distinct red sleep mask with eye markings. He carries it around with him and is rarely seen without it. It has a black border and red painted interior, decorated with wide-open eyes with straight lashes.</p>

		<p>During the events of the Dekoboko Arc, he switched genders due to a curse and was seen in his female form. Shinpachi describes the gender-swapped Sougo as a "Grade A beauty, as expected." Later during the arc, he wears a yellow short kimono and thigh high tabi black socks.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Personality</h2>
		<hr></hr>

		<p>Sougo's most prominent trait is his sadistic nature, an example of this being his collaring and chaining up Urara with a metal leash for an "S&M" (sadistic & masochistic) play. Hijikata even goes as far as calling him the King of the Planet of Sadists in episode 20. Although he is known as a sadist, he is extremely submissive to his sister, Okita Mitsuba, shown in his respectful way of speaking to her and the way he kneels before his sister to apologize. In episode 35, however, Sougo fell of a roller-coaster and admitted in his panic that his sadism stems from his insecurity.</p>

		<p>He is shown to have evil intentions behind any good thing he does, and is very blunt about his dislike towards other people, especially to Hijikata. Despite this, Sougo is usually protective of the ones he cares for, such as his sister, Okita Mitsuba, and his commander, Kondou Isao (although Sougo repeatedly calls him Gorilla); when an official insults Kondou, Sougo draws his sword to kill him before being stopped by Hijikata. Additionally, he is unexpectedly sensitive to others' feelings when it truly counts, often saving his comrades' lives in battles and even taking on burdens for other people.</p>

		<p>Sougo's ambition is to become the vice-commander of the Shinsengumi, and as such, he regularly attempts to usurp Hijikata of the position through various methods, ranging from framing him for murder (when he shoots Matsudaira and places the gun in Hijikata's hand with the intention of making it look like the vice-commander had been the one to shoot), to harming or even "killing" Hijikata. His attempts appear real enough that Hijikata was afraid he would get killed during the Shinsengumi Death Game arc. In spite of this, Sougo has respect for Hijikata and even considers him to be one of his 'three rotten friends' (the other two being Kondo and Sakata Gintoki). He also has a similar rivalry with Kagura of the Yorozuya, and the two often get in meaningless competitions over the smallest of situations.</p>

		<p>In general, Sougo acts aloof and disinterested most of the time and is most often seen with a blank, deadpan expression on his face. Though he often acts lazy and slacks off on his jobs, he is very attentive when needed and does not hesitate to kill or cut down his enemies. He is also very observant and aware of political movements, as he is often the one explaining situations to the Yorozuya. Both Nobume and Kamui have stated that Sougo has the eyes of a killer, yet he doesn't wish for innocent people to walk the path he has taken and be stained by blood. This is particularly evident in the Rokkaku arc, where he would rather take the blame and hatred of the daughter of the Rokkaku owner than let her know the cruel truth of her father's death. Additionally, in Episode 27, he shows distaste towards the Rengokukan fighting ring and enlists the Yorozuya to help him shut it down.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Relationships</h2>
		<hr></hr>

		<h2 class="family">Mentor</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Kanchou</span>: In childhood, Sougo often came to his dojo to practice. During a sword exercise (where students would swing a heavy piece of wood), he praised Sougo as a genius, before discovering a few seconds later that he was being tricked, after which he proceeded to scold Sougo.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="family">Family</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Okita Mitsuba</span>: Sougo is very attached to his older sister Okita Mitsuba, who brought him up from a young age when both were orphaned. He always speaks to her with great respect in contrast to his typical attitude towards everybody else. He has made wrong decisions for what he believed was for her sake; despite knowing that Mitsuba's fiance, Toma Kuraba, was a Joui rebel, he at first pleaded that Hijikata spare Toma, as Mitsuba was dying from a lung disease, and he wanted to her to experience happiness before she passed. But after learning that Toma was only using her as a bargaining chip to his advantage against the Shinsengumi, he ruthlessly dispatched him. He has shown emotions around her that he never shows anyone else, as she was the most important person to him, and was shown crying at her deathbed.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="family">Friends & Allies</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Kondou Isao</span>: Similar to many others, Sougo constantly teases Kondou and calls him by his nickname, Gorilla. However, Kondou is the only person besides Mitsuba whom Sougo is openly loyal to, loyal to the point where he sees himself as only one fitting to the position of vice-commander. This admiration stems from when he was a child--Kondou was the first person to make friends with him and became somewhat of a brotherly figure. Sougo went as far as threatening to kill an important foreign official for insulting Kondou and later pretending to betray Hijikata so that he could remain by Kondou's side.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Hijikata Toushizo</span>: He often commits acts of violence toward Hijikata in a deadpan manner or with a sarcastic smarmy attitude, leaving the audience constantly wondering whether he is really serious about killing Hijikata or not. For now, he just seems to play dangerous jokes. Sougo's ambition is to become Vice-commander of the Shinsengumi, he same position Hijikata currently holds.
 			Events during the Okita Mitsuba Arc hint that he is jealous of Hijikata always appearing to usurp the attention of those near and dear to him. It is an undisputed claim that he is the strongest swordsman, but Hijikata can bring out the weaknesses in him, shown in Episode 86 when Sougo loses a match to him. A list of his 'attacks' on Hijikata Toushirou can be found here. Despite the fact that he always tries to kill him, Sougo considers Hijikata as an important figure and a friend, treating him with respect in serious situations as shown in the Prison Island arc.</li>

 			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Sakata Gintoki</span>: Referring to him "Boss", Okita seems to get along rather well with Gintoki. After a rough beginning, the two find common ground in their love of torturing and humiliating Hijikata. After witnessing the fight between Gintoki and Hijikata, Okita said he would love to clash swords with Gintoki one day. Although a hit from Hijikata would often result in a violent retribution from Okita, he doesn't seem to have a problem with taking a lecture or a knock on the head from Gintoki. When his sister came to visit, Okita bribed Gintoki with chocolate parfaits to pretend that he was his best friend. Though this was a charade meant to reassure his sister, Okita does consider Gintoki to be one of his 'three rotten friends.'</li>

 			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Kagura</span>: Sougo calls her 'China Girl' or 'China'. After the Cherry Blossom party, they would often fight whenever they had a chance. Kagura is one of the only female characters in the entire series whom he has apologized to, the other being his sister. He's the only one who notices Kagura is faking her illness in Episode 297, but he chooses to sit back and sadistically watch her 'literally' dig her own grave. In the Yagyu Arc, when Kagura was in danger, Sougo saves her and states that only he was allowed to beat her; later, however, when Sougo bends her wrist the wrong way in his 'attempt' to mend it, Kagura retaliates by breaking his leg. When the two realise they will be unable to fight by themselves, they reluctantly team up, showing that despite their ongoing rivalry towards each other, they can work together when needed. This can further be seen in the Rokkaku Arc--when Kagura was shot in the leg and being chased by a group of terrorists, Sougo helped her escape at great risk to his own life. In chapter 534/Episode 312, he manages to save Kagura at the last minute when she falls from a cliff, holding on even though she shouts to let go before the incoming arrows come their way. He also tries to protect her from Nobume, whom he believed intended to kill her. In the aftermath of the Farewell Shinsengumi arc, it is not clear whether Sougo actively seeks Kagura out to say goodbye, but they have one last, bittersweet fight before he departs, during which they both tell each other to not lose to anybody else, echoing Sougo's earlier words in the Yagyu arc.</li>

 			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Shimura Shinpachi</span>: Sougo treats Shinpachi quite well in comparison to other people since Shinpachi does not offend people as much as the other two Yorozuya members. Kondo additionally issued a new law in Shinsengumi that stated all members had to treat Shinpachi well.</li>

 			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Shimura Tae</span>: He's one of the two Shinsengumi members (the other being Hijikata) who has personally witnessed how dangerous Shinpachi's sister can be when Kondo Isao becomes particularly insistent in his stalking. As fellow sadists, Sougo respects her. During the Gender Bender Arc, Otae tried to rip off female Okita's breasts as she was infuriated by how big they were.</li>

 			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Sarutobi Ayame</span>: He and Sarutobi first met in Episode 83 at the cabaret club when Sougo took note of her masochism tendencies and quickly formed a bond as S&M enthusiasts. In the Host Club Arc, Sarutobi compliments him when he suggests that he pin her nose back with hooks and posts pictures of it around town for the G-course he was offering. In Episode 277 during the Dekoboko Arc, Sarutobi becomes Lady Souko's advisor at Club Sadist as she becomes the top courtesan in the Kabuki District.</li>

 			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Tokugawa Soyo</span>: In Shogun Assassination Arc after receiving orders from Hijikata, Sougo went on the ship to defend it from insurgents. He protected Soyo when Kamui attacked and lead Jii-ya and Soyo to safety after the ship went down, earning her utmost gratitude, despite him feeling inadequate about his failed mission.</li>

 			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Katsura Kotarou</span>: Formerly a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, Katsura was constantly attacked by the Shinsengumi, especially Sougo. They become allies later during the Farewell Shinsengumi Arc.</li>
