		<p>Shimura Shinpachi (志村 新八, Shimura Shinpachi) is a member of the Yorozuya, a samurai in training, and one of the three main protagonists of Gintama. He is one of the more normal characters of the series, delivering the requisite reality-checks or punchlines against other characters' antics.

		<p>Shimura Shinpachi grew up with his sister Shimura Tae and his father in their family dojou Koudoukan. Their father died when they were young, leaving them to take care of the dojou and the debt to the Loan Shark Amanto.[1]</p>

		<p>At his local temple school, Shinpachi befriended Takachin. When Takachin was bullied by other children, Shinpachi tried to help but ended getting beaten up as well until Otae saved them. They were close friends until Takachin accidently soiled himself while Shinpachi pretended to be sleeping to avoid helping Takachin.</p>

		<p>Shinpachi would later become acquainted with Yagyuu Kyuubei due to his sister's friendship with her. When the debt collectors tried to harm Tae and her brother, Shinpachi was knocked out by the time Kyuubei came to help them, although it cost her her left eye.</p>

		<p>Shinpachi mentioned that he ate his sister's cooking when he was younger, which made his eyesight go bad and resulted in his need to wear glasses.</p>

		<p>While working at a café and being beaten by the manager behind the shop, Shinpachi encountered Terakado Tsuu during one of her street performances. Although he didn't understood her song, he was emotionally moved. After gaining encouragement and motivation from this encounter, Shinpachi would create the Terakado Tsuu fanclub: Terakado Tsuu's Imperial Guards.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Appearance</h2>
		<hr></hr>

		<p>Shinpachi has black hair and brown eyes. He wears a light blue keikogi with blue linings and a blue hakama. Many other characters have pointed out that Shinpachi's glasses are his charm point. Sakata Gintoki even went as far as to say that Shinpachi's glasses make out 95% of him and that they are more Shinpachi than Shinpachi himself, with the rest being 3% water and 2% garbage. [2] His poor eyesight is supposedly caused by chronic ingestion of dark materials (egg) cooked by his beloved elder sister, Otae.</p>

		<p>Throughout the series he is seen wearing various disguises and has been shown in different styles for gags.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Personality</h2>
		<hr></hr>

		<p>Shinpachi is best known for his Tsukkomi (being a straight man) when other people especially Gintoki or Kagura say or do idiotic things, which happens very often. He is frequently teased by Sakata Gintoki, his supposed employer, and later on by Yagyuu Kyuubei for having a 'sister-complex' because of his attachment towards his sister. Since he doesn't have as much physical strength as Kagura, he is often bullied by her, who often tends to literally give him a thrashing. He takes charge of all the household chores in the Yorozuya due to his 'inclination to care for other people (as he explained during the Goukon in Episode 88). He also likes to save leftovers, bringing Tupperware to store the food and is called 'domestic' because of it. All of the above points, combined with his plain bespectacled look has made him the archetypical downtrodden nerdy character. Shinpachi is also a rabid fan of fictional pop-idol Terakado Tsuu, and often gets so moved by her songs that he starts crying listening to them. He is the strict leader of the Terakado Tsuu's Imperial Guards,a fan club with deep admiration and devotion to her, and has made 99 regulations that he makes sure the members loyally follow. Whenever someone breaks one of the rules and regulations of the fanclub, he personally issues their punishment with a flying nose-hook. Most of the time, the Sergeant is on the receiving end. Shinpachi himself has been shown to break some of the regulations that he punishes others for doing the same. Shinpachi also likes to sing, and has been seen singing karaoke-versions of various songs by Tsuu, but is completely tone-deaf.[3]</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<h2 class="family">Family</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Shimura Tae</span>: Shinpachi's older sister. They care about each other very much to the point that Gintoki says Shinpachi has a sister complex.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Shimura Ken</span>: Shinpachi's father. When they were young Shinpachi & her older sister Shimura Tae were always getting punished by their father for fooling around.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="family">Mentor</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Obi Hajime</span>: He was the former chief coach of the Koudoukan. He was like an older brother to Shinpachi and Otae. He went missing before Shinpachi met Gintoki travelling around the Galaxy.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Gintoki Sakata</span>: Shinpachi follows Gintoki with admiration for him in order to learn the way of the samurai, which leads him to work in Yorozuya. He quite regrets following him because of Gintoki's irresponsibility for everything, but at the same time they started to have adventures which leads Shinpachi to start considering him as mentor and brother. He even got mad at Gintoki when he didn't consider him as a brother when Gintoki told Umibouzu about not having a family. Gintoki is the only person he would listen to whenever he refuses to listen to his sister. During the Guardian Dog Arc, he said to Nakamura Kyoujirou that he considered Gintoki as a family.
		</ul>

		<h2 class="family">Friends</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Kagura</span>: Kagura is close to Shinpachi even though she beats him or offends him often. However they both care for each other very deeply as comrades as even though they have their differences they would always help each other when they need it and they have the common care and respect for Gintoki.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Yagyuu Kyuubei</span>: Kagura is close to Shinpachi even though she beats him or offends him often. However they both care for each other very deeply as comrades as even though they have their differences they would always help each other when they need it and they have the common care and respect for Gintoki.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Kondou Isao</span>: Shinpachi views him as a annoying stalker and most of the times he would prefer having Gintoki as a brother-in-law rather than Kondou. Just as Kagura and Gintoki share parallels with Okita and Hijikata, Shinpachi and Kondou seem to share being the softer ones of the trio and often the butt of their jokes.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Katsura Kotarou</span>: They are very respectful to each other, but at times Shinpachi wonders about Katsura's lack of common sense. Just like the other members of Yorozuya, he does seek advice from Katsura every once in a while.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Yamazaki Sagaru</span>: They both share being the plain characters as well as the straight man in many situations. They are often opponents when the Yorozuya goes against the Shinsengumi.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Okita Sougo</span>: Unlike most of other people who become his torturing victims, Sougo had a respect for him like most of other Shinsengumi, as shown during pen pal arc. This could be because Kondou has instructed the Shinsengumi to be nice to Shinpachi.</li>
