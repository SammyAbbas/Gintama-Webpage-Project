		<p>During her childhood Kagura lived in the slums of a faraway planet with her father, mother and older brother. At one point, her older brother injured his right arm through unknown means but he hid it from his and Kagura's mother but not Kagura. Later on in her childhood her older brother Kamui attempted to kill their father Umibouzu, however he failed and only managed to cut off his father's arm. This caused Umibouzu to go berserk and he nearly killed Kamui but was stopped by Kagura. Soon after that, Umibozu left the family. In fear that he might harm her unintentionally just like Kamui, Umibozu left to avoid destroying his family any further [1].
		While at home, Kagura was left with taking care of her sick mother and she would wait for Umibouzu to come back from his alien hunting work. Kagura called her mother 'Mummy' and she remembered her as a beautiful woman. Her mother died of an illness when she was very young. Knowing her brother and father weren't around, she traveled to Earth to start a new life.</p>

		<p>Kagura had a number of pets named 'Sadaharu No. #' before the current Inugami Sadaharu came along. The previous pets all died because of her own inability to control her strength. 'Sadaharu No. 28' was the latest deceased addition in the form of a dung beetle. 'Sadaharu No.1' was a rabbit.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Appearance</h2>
		<hr></hr>

		<p>Kagura has vermilion red hair and ocean blue eyes. She has fair skin (snow white according to Takechi Henpeita in Episode 59). She typically wears a red cheongsam with yellow piping. Her hair is tied in two knots to the sides of her head and are covered with ornaments. When outside, she's usually seen carrying a purple parasol around, which works as protection from the sun. In the special episode 1-2 her description says that she has a cute appearance (but also a rather sharp tongue). Like all Yato her body is well developed with muscle.</p>

		<p>Throughout the series it shows that grows a bit, initially being 155 cm height, but then closer to the height of Shinpachi. In the Timeskip arc, however, at 16 years old, she was taller than him at 170 cm. Her hair was longer and fastened with clips. She also wore goggles. She wore a two piece outfit that resembled a cheong sam and revealed her midriff, laced with gold. The top piece has a high collar which covered her neck.</p>

		<p>During the events of the Dekoboko Arc she switched genders due to a curse and was seen in her male form. In that form, she had long hair that was slicked back and she had a beard. She had a scar on her left eye and was wearing a samurai suit. She was also much taller and had a well-built body.</p>

		<p>During the Movie Be Forever Yorozuya, Kagura was as tall as Shinpachi and had longer hair with a bun on the right side of her head. She wears a long white cheongsam with red buttons. The bottom of the cheongsam is decorated with the pattern seen on Gintoki's yukata. Her umbrella is also bigger, almost as tall as herself.</p>

		<p>Throughout the series she is seen wearing various disguises for gags.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Relationships</h2>
		<hr></hr>

		<h2 class="family">Family</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Umibouzu</span>: Her father. She feels embarrassed in his presence because of his baldness. She called Umibouzu 'Papi' and since he started balding, Hage (meaning bald-head). Kagura's dream is to travel with him to become the best female alien hunter once she is strong enough to do so.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Kamui</span>: Her older brother. She calls her brother Baka-nii-chan (a.k.a. stupid older brother). She hates him for leaving their mother bedridden but actually cares for him very much. In Episode 146, Umibouzu highlighted that Kagura, in spite of saying she hates Kamui, wanted to save him from his destructiveness. He was also her primary opponent before their final fight (Everyone vs Kamui).</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Kouka</span>: Her deceased mother who she shows tremendous amounts of respect to. She calls her 'Mami' in co-ordinance with 'Papi', which she called her father. Not much is known about her except for her combat skills shown in Lesson 579 along side Kankou, now Umibouzu, whilst the pursuit to woo her and tame the Orochies in the Yato home planet, Kounan.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="friends">Friends & Allies</h2>
		<ul>
			<img src="images/kagura/kaguragintokifighting.png" alt="Kagura and Gintoki fighting" class="relationshipkagura">
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Sakata Gintoki</span>: Their relationship seems to be of a "father/daughter" or "older brother/little sister" relationship. In the confession arc Kagura says that she came to earth to marry a human, and described her future husband exactly as Gintoki, it is very likely that he spoke of him. She greatly admires the man she calls "Gin-chan" and has picked up several of Gintoki's habits such as picking her nose. They do many different gags together and are usually partners in crime. As the series progresses, it could even be said that Kagura is a mini Gintoki as stated often by Shinpachi.</li>

			<img src="images/kagurashinpachi.jpg" alt="Kagura and Shinpachi" class="relationshipkagura">
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Shimura Shinpachi</span>: Shinpachi is close to Kagura, although Kagura is often not polite to him and even bullies him mercilessly. Kagura refers to him simply as "Shinpachi" though has often referred to him as Patsuan, similar to Gintoki. Kagura cares for him to the point that when he was getting beaten to death in Yoshiwara, it awakened her hidden Yato strength, though Shinpachi did eventually calm her down.</li>

			<img src="images/Sadaharu.png" alt="Sadaharu" class="relationshipkagura">
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Sadaharu</span>: This Sadaharu is actually the 27th Sadaharu pet she ever had. Since her other 27 (plus Sadaharu 28, 'killed' by Sougo) has died, she treasures Sadaharu #27 a lot. She adores the current Sadaharu very much, to the point of going everywhere with him and she is seen cuddling with the dog whenever she feels upset. Gintoki and Shinpachi always seem to have a hard time controlling him, but she does it with ease because of Sadaharu's special affection for her and also due to her own strength.</li>

			<img src="images/kagura/tae.jpg" alt="Tae Image" class="relationshipkagura">
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Shimura Tae</span>: Otae is like a big sister to Kagura. Kagura respects Otae very much, calling Otae "Anego" (a term usually used by gangsters to women they respect). She greatly respects her, and also fears her cooking.</li>

			<br></br>
			<br></br>
			<br></br>
			<img src="images/okitaandkagura1.jpg" alt="Okita and Kagura" class="relationshipkagura">
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Okita Sougo</span>: Though the two are rivals, they still begrudgingly respect each other. Whenever they encounter each other, they usually fight or compete over anything, though it is normally Okita who instigates those fights (as seen in the Beetle arc). Kagura refers to him as a 'Super Sadist.' When the two are simultaneously angry, Sougo's blue aura and Kagura's red aura combine and become purple (as seen in the Beetle and the Carnival arc). In the Rengokukan arc, Kagura remarks, "that guy (Okita) definitely likes me," though this is never confirmed nor denied. Kagura is the second known female character who Sougo apologizes to (during the Vacation arc), the first being his sister (Mitsuba). She showed appreciation for his protecting Soyo from her 'bothersome idiot' of a brother, and for inflicting an injury on Kamui which she would later use to her advantage during their fight. During the Farewell Shinsengumi arc, she encouraged him when he was feeling down, hiding her good intentions behind casual insults. When saying goodbye at the end of the arc, they both tell each other to not lose to anybody else. As stated by Shinpachi, the two do actually get along quite well, and despite their ongoing rivalry towards each other, they seem to have a sense of camaraderie.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Hasegawa Taizou</span>:  Kagura was the one who gave Hasegawa the name MADAO.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Katsura Kotaru </span>: She is on good terms with Katsura, Katsura calls her 'Leader' because Kagura insisted on wearing the red ninja costume in episode 43, since the red costume are usually worn by the group leader. She dislikes Katsura's idiocy about as much as Gintoki does but she often asks him for favors such as helping Kintaro and the old man meet. She respects his strength and Katsura would give advice to her.</li>

			<img src="images/kagura/soyo.png" alt="Soyo and Kagura" class="relationshipkagura">
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Soyo Hime</span>: She's the one who introduced Soyo to her favorite food Sukonbu. Kagura helps her 'be a normal girl' for a day, dealing with the Shinsengumi, and taking a purikura with her. They remained on good terms since Soyo helped them get inside the castle during the Ikokku Keisei arc. Together with Imai Nobume, the three are called the "Sadistic Sisterhood Three" by Shinpachi.</li>
		</ul>

		<br></br>
		<h2 class="enemies">Enemies</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Kijima Matako</span>: During Benizakura Arc, she was Kagura's primary opponent, much like Henpeita was Shinpachi's. Matako detests her for launching threats at Takasugi Shinsuke and for embarrassing her in front of Shinsuke. They maintain this enmity during the Rakuyou arc though do work together when their interests overlapped.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Abuto</span>: A fellow Yato clansman. She and Shinpachi fought against Yato veteran who clearly overpowered them. When Shinpachi was almost killed by Abuto, Kagura lost all her sanity which led her to surrender herself to Yato's destructive nature. Her "awakened" state allowed her to defeat Abuto. He also noted that Kagura was also capable of defeating Hosen.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue">Inoue</span>:  In Episode 4 when he refused to let her escape his gang, refusing to let her run away after using her as a human weapon.</li>
