		<p><img src="images/katsura/katsuragrave.jpg" alt="Katsura at Grave" class="katsuregrave">In his childhood, Katsura's parents died due to an illness. He and his grandmother were then stripped of their home and for some time they wandered the streets, homeless. While visiting the grave of his parents, his grandmother taught him that no matter how strong or great a warrior may be, if he dies, he wouldn't be able to protect his country or any other people at all. So in order to be a great general, one must be more careful and more fearful in order to survive and lead the war.</p>

		<p>It is unknown what he was doing after his grandmother died. But he gained a reputation for being clever which allowed him to receive a scholarship to his village's prestigious military school. He was friends with Takasugi Shinsuke at this time. The duo encounters Yoshida Shouyou, who had opened a free school for mostly poor children, and Sakata Gintoki, a child whom Shouyou was raising. Katsura and Takasugi were already disillusioned with their education, disgusted with their fellow students' pomposity and became attracted to Shouyou's philosophy. They will drop out of the military school and join Shouyou's for the next few years.</p>

		<p>During the Kansei Purge, Shouyou is arrested and Katsura joins the ongoing Joui War with Takasugi, Gintoki and the other students to save him. It is during the war that he earned the nicknames Runaway Kotarou, for his strategic retreats, and The Noble Youth of Madness, for his poise when participating in battles. It is also at this time when he met Sakamoto Tatsuma. During a battle (but after Sakamoto was taken off the front lines because of an injury), everyone except Katsura, Takasugi, and Gintoki were killed while said trio were captured. It is then that Katsura and Takasugi were forced to watch as the teacher they joined the war to save was executed, their friend Gintoki being forced to do the deed. After their enemies left, the trio buried their teacher's head and their comrades' corpses then went their separate ways.</p>

		<p>For the next ten years, Katsura will continue his Joui activities underground, forming his own faction and learning all he can about what his enemies, the bakufu are doing. This includes learning about the formation of the Shinsengumi.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Appearance</h2>
		<hr></hr>

		<p>He has long black hair (Okada Nizou wondered whether Katsura is really a man, for having such silky hair in Episode 58). He sports olive-brown eyes and has an attractive demeanour. Neptune Shoukaku in Episode 319 describes him as a dainty guy with effeminate and delicate features. He typically wears a blue kimono with a yellow sash. The fact that he typically wears a pale blue haori on top of his kimono and white socks with slippers suggests that he is particular about how he dresses and carries himself. He is never seen lying around or sitting in a unrefined manner, and he typically keeps his arms in his sleeves when not carrying anything. Since he is a wanted man, Katsura usually uses disguises to hide from Shinsengumi or to wander freely in public.</p>

		</div>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Personality</h2>
		<hr></hr>

		<p>Katsura's illogical decisions often suggest him to be a complete moron, though this may be a result of his lack of common sense rather than actual stupidity as in his childhood he was considered a talented genius who was able to attend a prestigious school without having the money to pay for it. Despite that, Katsura couldn't identify the Shogun by his physical appearance, or by his nickname "Shou-chan" during the Confessional Arc. It was later revealed that both the Shogun and the Joui rebel knew each other all along. Although he appears as an idiot most of the time in the series, he is very smart and sensible when serious circumstances arise. Katsura is hardly ever seen joking, which only serves to amplify the oddities of his character. He also has an extreme imagination and improvisation, as he sometimes does the voices of some inanimate objects and tends to have long and dramatic flashbacks and reflections out of pointless matters.</p>

		<p>Katsura is also very persistent and kept pestering Gintoki to join him in his Jouishishi rebellion. He is a charismatic leader and commands great respect from his followers. One of his Joui followers described him as a man who cannot back down once he gets into high spirits over something. In fact he was able to rally a big group of followers in a very short time during his prison stint in Episode 110.</p>

		<p>Thrifty in habit, he eats simple meals like soba, and once advised Elizabeth against eating 'strawberry milk and parfait' so as not to weaken the body and the spirit (see Episode 58), though he has a soft-spot for nmaibo (んまい棒, Nmaibo), a corn snack modelled after umaibo (うまい棒, umaibo).</p>

		<p>Katsura is very polite, usually adding the honorific "dono" to people. He takes great care not to offend any person. When he thought he offended the human punching bag, he gladly offered his "treasure", a borrowed Nintendo cartridge. Katsura also loves animals, especially the paw pads of dogs and cats.</p>

		<p>In the beginning of the series, Katsura hated the world for taking away Yoshida Shouyou life and was willing to cause destruction against the government and Shinsengumi. But after seeing how Gintoki acted and falling out with Takasugi after the Benizakura Arc, he decided to find more peaceful solutions. It is also possible that his encounter with Ikumatsu and hearing about her past might had influenced him as well.</p>

		<p>His sense of self-preservation started in his childhood, since his parents died from an illness, having been stripped off of their mansion, and he was left roaming the streets together with his grandmother. While visiting the grave of his parents, his grandmother told him that no matter how strong or great a warrior may be, if he dies, he wouldn't be able to protect his country or anyone at all. So to be a great general, one must be more careful and more fearful in order to survive and lead the war. When his grandmother died, he was on his own until he met Sakata Gintoki and Takasugi Shinsuke. While studying under Yoshida Shouyou, he made a resolve to be "a samurai who is both more cowardly and stronger than anyone else" so he could protect his comrades. This resolve earned him the nickname "Runaway Kotarou".</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Relationships</h2>
		<hr></hr>

		<h2 class="family">Family</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Yoshida Shouyou</span> : Katsura studied under Shouyou together with Gintoki and Takasugi and joined the Joui Patriots to fight for his freedom after he was arrested under Sada Sada's orders. The Tendoshu forced Gintoki to choose between saving either Shouyou or Katsura and Takasugi, with their teacher sacrificing himself in order to save Katsura, and his friends' lives.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="family">Friends & Allies</h2>
		<ul>
			<img src="images/katsura/gintokikatsura.png" alt="Katsura and Gintoki" class="relationshipimage">
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Gintoki Sakata</span> : Katsura and Gintoki have known each other since they were children. They usually fight alongside with each other, so they can be considered very close friends. Gintoki always calls Katsura by the nickname "Zura", which literally means "wig", even though Katsura prefers his real name. Katsura always tries to recruit Gintoki to his organization but ultimately fails as Gintoki isn't interested in fighting a futile fight. After meeting with him more and more he has started to become more benevolent and tries to find more peaceful solutions to the Amanto infestation instead of just extreme violence. Although he witnessed Gintoki being forced to execute Shouyou by the Tendoshuu during their capture in the Joui war, he still forgives Gintoki and understands the regret Gintoki has for killing Shouyou in order to save his, and his friends' lives and also to keep his promise to Shouyou. He even told Takasugi in the Benizakura arc that he too wanted to destroy the world; yet Gintoki, who has more right to be angry at the world than anyone else but still choose endures it, they should honor his decision as well.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Sakamoto Tatsuma</span> : They fought in the Joui war together with Gintoki and Takasugi and are good friends. Although they haven't interacted with each other much after the Jouishishi war, they are still on good terms as seen in the Renho arc. Sakamoto gave Elizabeth to Katsura as a pet. Sakamoto knew about Katsura's childhood as well, when the former discussed who is the strongest in the group among the Joui rebels during the war. He defended Katsura when the men implied he was cowardly, revealing his admiration and understanding of Katsura.</li>

			<img src="images/katsura/elizabeth.png" alt="Katsura and Elizabeth" class="relationshipimage">
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Elizabeth</span> : He is always accompanied by Elizabeth from Episode 15 onwards, and he is very attached to it and went to its rescue when it was 'kidnapped' in Episode 44. Katsura's affection for Elizabeth is so great he refuses to acknowledge that Elizabeth is just a man in sheets despite seeing a picture of the chubby man in an x-ray in Episode 129. Katsura is overprotective of Elizabeth as he'll pursue any person who injures him.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Kagura</span> : In Episode 44, he wanted to have the red ninja suit which usually is for the leader of the team. Kagura told him that red is her color and she should be the leader. She commanded Katsura to call her "Leader" which he always did ever since. She also said that the color yellow fits him well and he should always bring curry with him, thus having the title "Curry Ninja". He mentioned to Gintoki that she would make a good samurai, much to her dismay. Kagura calls Katsura "Zura" just like Gintoki.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Shimura Shinpachi</span> : They are very respectful to each other, but at times Shinpachi wonders about Katsura's lack of common sense. Just like the other two members of Yorozuya, he does seek advice from Katsura every once in a while.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Kondou Isao</span> : When Kondo was the commander of the Shinsengumi, he and Katsura were rivals. Kondo was always shown chasing after Katsura and they would always fight over similar nicknames such as Fruit Punch/Chinpo Samurai. In Episode 88 they lost their memories and become friends (temporarily), and both mentioned that "I have a feeling that I was a person who protected the world peace. So we must've been comrades." Apparently they have the same peaceful goals, despite being enemies once. They worked together during the Farewell, Shinsengumi Arc in order to fight the enemy forces that ambushed them. Also, Katsura shielded Kondo before Sasaki Isaburo shot him, taking the hit instead, much to Kondo's worry.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Matsudaira Katakuriko</span> : Although they were enemies once before Shinsengumi was disbanded by the new Shogun Hitotsubashi Nobu Nobu after their friend, Shige Shige, died after being poisoned by Tendoshuu's assassins. He first assisted him while he was undercover as the assistant Ezurako to know about Matsudaira's status in 2 days, and the Shinsengumi Director's daughter's birthday, where she was taken hostage by some Joui terrorists in the following day. After assisting Matsudaira in rescuing his daughter, Matsudaira spared Katsura afterwards. During Nobu Nobu's reign after Shinsengumi was disbanded and with the Director and the Chief Kondo were about to be executed five days later, at the same time Nobu Nobu and Mimawarigumi threatened Tae, Gintoki, Heiji, Haji, and the former Shinsengumi Vice Chief Hijikata, Katsura sacrifices himself and saved them, in order to save Kondo and Matsudaira from execution before five days later. He had already made a promise with the late-Shige Shige to carry on his peaceful will if the late-wise Shogun died, and already planned to call a truce with Shinsengumi to save Edo and also Earth from Tendoshuu and the currently corrupted Bakufu.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Takasugi Shinsuke</span> : He and Takasugi met in childhood before meeting Yoshida-sensei and Gintoki. Takasugi who is about to be disowned by his Samurai family would often hang out in a temple. Katsura would visit him and even offered onigiri. Both of them would often talk about what it's like to be samurai and would be curious later on upon seeing Yoshida Shoyou and Gintoki. After the war and the death of their teacher, all of them lost sight of each other. Katsura was just like Takasugi (wanting to destroy the world) only to change his mind after being reunited again with Gintoki and learning to love the people in Edo. During the Benizakura arc, he tried to convince Takasugi to renounce his violent activities but failed as Takasugi only desired destruction. Although seen frequently looking out for him in flashbacks, he later claimed that he never liked Takasugi to begin with but still considered him as a comrade. Katsura and Gintoki swore that the next time they meet, they would do everything to take him down. During the escape he mentioned to Gintoki that they all started at one place yet ended up far away from each other. After Takasugi realized why Gintoki saved them for their master's will that has been passed to them to move on, Katsura may seemingly reconcile with him.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Yagyuu Kyuubei</span> : Since Kyuubei had more frequent appearances than Katsura, the latter became very jealous stating that their characters are overlapping each other for the dead-serious/eggheaded character, though Gintoki has mentioned many times that their characters don't overlap. Despite this, Katsura was ranked as the more popular character of the two. Despite this, they get along during her birhday or when they got lost on an unknown island during the Ryuuguujou Arc.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Tokugawa Shige Shige</span> : When Shige Shige was alive and lost his memory, Katsura took him in to his Joui Army and taught him how to be a cool leader. However, Katsura got defeated by Shige Shige and all members of Katsura's Joui army taught of Shige Shige as a true leader, including Elizabeth. Katsura and Shige Shige decided to compete with each other to see who can get Soyo Hime's head to become the true leader. However it turned out it was all an act and Shige Shige told Katsura that the next time they meet, one of them get will lose their head. Despite being enemies, they have the same will to change Edo into a better place. He did mourn his death before learning that Kondo was also about to be executed in five days later during Nobu Nobu's reign.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Hijikata Toushirou</span> : Formerly as a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, Katsura was constantly attacked by the Shinsengumi, especially Hijikata. Most of all, he always was quickly handcuffed by Hijikata and couldn't escape easily. After Shige Shige's death, they become allies due to the corruption of the Bakufu caused thanks to Tendoshu. After the first rebellion during a rescue mission to save Matsudaira and Kondo, but which resulted in the sacrifice of Isaburo, Katsura suggested the Shinsengumi and the other special police forces loyal to Shige Shige like Mimawarigumi to leave Edo with his faction since it is currently ruled by Nobu Nobu and is not safe for them to stay in Edo, and it's for the sake of the Edo citizens. Hijikata agreed with Katsura's suggestion.</li>

			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Okita Sougo</span> : Formerly as a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, Katsura was constantly attacked by the Shinsengumi, especially Sougo. Later, when a war between the Mimawarigumi, the Tendoushu and the combined forces of the Yorozuya, Shinsengumi and Katsura's Joui faction started, they become allies.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="family">Love Interest</h2>
		<ul>
			<img src="images/katsura/ikumatsu.png" alt="Katsura and Ikumatsu" class="relationshipimage">
			<li class="relation"><span style="color: lightblue;">Ikumatsu</span> : Katsura encounters Ikumatsu as he was on the run from the Shinsengumi in Episode 39. He is shown to be sympathetic over the death of Ikumatsu's husband who was killed during a conflict involving the Jouishishi. Katsura would use Ikumatsu's ramen store to place an interview with the news reporter. In the Benizakura Arc, Ikumatsu was one of the people that was shown to be important for him. In Chapter 431, he admitted that he's in love with Ikumatsu's soba. After Katsura's run in with the Shinsengumi in Episode 39 and the events that took place in that Episode, Katsura has been seen to periodically dine at Ikumatsu's place. Many other characters, including Gintoki and Ikumatsu's brother-in-law, have suggested that Katsura has romantic feelings for Ikumatsu, with Gintoki even asking Katsura if he had ever slept with Ikumatsu. Each time, Katsura responds with a flustered and overexaggerated dismissal of the idea, implying that he does in fact have feelings for her. He also insists that Ikumatsu only has feelings for her deceased husband.</li>
