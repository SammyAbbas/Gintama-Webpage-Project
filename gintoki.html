		<p>It is unknown where he was born, what happened to his parents and what he was doing before becoming a child scavenger. It is also unknown how long he was doing this. He gained the nickname "Corpse Eating Demon" from the nearby villagers due to being commonly seen wandering in desert battlefields searching corpses for food and weapons to survive. During one search, Gintoki encounters Yoshida Shouyou who had heard the rumors about the child and came to investigate it. Taking a liking to Gintoki and seeing himself in the child, Shouyou gave Gintoki his sword and asked him to come. Gintoki became Shouyou's first student on his newly opened school, Shoka Sonjuku, where he learned basic swordsmanship and academics. After gathering more students, all mostly poor, the school earns the attention and scrutiny of the wealthier people in the village. They also gained the attention of two military academics students who have become disillusioned with the academy and the people attending it, Katsura Kotarou and Takasugi Shinsuke. The two were attracted by the school's goal for the children, striving to achieve their own ideal of a samurai while struggling against themselves. The two will later join officially after helping to fend off some officials from trying to arrest Shouyou. Gintoki himself will later earn a rival, Takasugi.</p>

		<p>Years later during the Kansei Purge, despite Gintoki's best efforts to stop them, the Tenshouin Naraku arrested Shouyou and burned down the school. Before leaving, Shouyou asked Gintoki to protect his fellow students, as a promise, to which Gintoki mentally agreed. After learning what happened, the students decided to join the ongoing Joui War on the Joui side to rescue their imprisoned teacher. They met Sakamoto Tatsuma during the fight and Gintoki gains the nickname Shiroyasha ("White Demon") due to his mostly white attire and silver hair and, of course, his ferocious fighting style. At one point, Takasugi asked Gintoki to protect Shouyou but in his stead though Gintoki never truly agreed and instead asked Takasugi for a promise, to stay alive. During a battle, after Sakamoto was taken off the front lines because of an injury, everyone except Katsura, Takasugi and Gintoki were killed while said trio were captured. Gintoki was forced to choose between killing Shouyou to save Katsura and Takasugi or the opposite. He decided to keep his promise to Shouyou and protected his friends but in turn "broke" his promise to Takasugi. Shouyou gives him a final "thank you" before Gintoki beheaded him. After their enemies left, the trio buried their teacher's head and their comrades' corpses and then went their separate ways, leaving the war. Sakamoto was only able to find Gintoki before he too left.</p>

		<p>Sometime later, a wandering Gintoki overheard a man trying to offer his daughter to be executed in his place to a group of officials. The man was a Joui informant who had given up information on certain Joui and their families to these officials that belonged to a political faction in the government. Gintoki offered himself up in the daughter's place to protect her and both he and the informant were arrested. In jail he unknowingly met the girl that he saved, who was adopted by the executioner, the 16th Ikeda Yaemon. He saw Gintoki's deeds and, after executing Asaemon's father, declared that he had no right to execute the person who was a good man and then released him. Injured and starving he wandered in the cold winter night to a graveyard to die until he encountered Otose, leaving food offerings to her husband's grave where he was leaning on. He asked her if he could have the manjuu offerings she set out and she told him to ask her husband, who was receiving the offerings instead of her. Gintoki then ate her husband's manjuu without asking him saying that dead people don't talk. In return, he made a promise to her husband that he would protect Otose until she dies.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Appearance</h2>
		<hr></hr>

		<p>Gintoki has naturally wavy hair which causes him no end of distress. His silvery-blue hair is in a perpetually messy state, which is sometimes exaggerated into a frizzy afro when Gintoki's hair is hit by extreme heat. He has indeterminate grey/green (in the manga) or bordeaux-colored (in the anime) "dead fish eyes" (comparison courtesy of Hijikata Toushirou), which are called such because they are nearly always half-lidded.</p>

		<p>His standard outfit consists of a white yukata with a blue swirl pattern on the bottom and at the end of the sleeves, worn so that his arm only goes through the left sleeve and the right half droops down over his obi. Over this he wears a black belt buckled so that there is leftover dangling from the buckle, from which his bokutō Lake Toya hangs. Underneath, he wears a black red-lined shirt with a popped collar and black pants. He also wears knee-high black boots, buckled at the top and above his foot, which appear to add about half an inch to his height. It is shown that he has a closet full of replicas of this outfit, so whenever it gets destroyed he can appear in the next episode or chapter with a new one. All in all, his outfit suggests an air of laziness and may be a reflection of Gintoki's own personal sense of style, though it is revealed that his usual attire is actually the school jersey for the Zunborans (episode 292).</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Personality</h2>
		<hr></hr>

		<p>Gintoki is extremely lazy. He is often seen wearing a dumb expression on his face and spends his days lounging around reading Shounen Jump whilst imparting wise and sage-like advice to his younger employees, even though he doesn't actually know what he's talking about most of the time. Due to his poverty and unwillingness to do mostly anything, he is always behind on his rent and often runs away when Otose, his landlady, comes to collect the payment. He often blows all of his savings on Pachinko and other gambling games, which Shinpachi and Kagura often scold him for. However, even though he is lazy, Gintoki is quite dedicated to his job and tries to help people with the best of his abilities (usually in a very strange and twisted way).</p>

		<p>Gintoki's past continues to influence who he is and how he acts. He admitted to Umibozu in episode 42 that he believes that having a loving family is all someone really needs in life, due to his lack of a family during his childhood. He is very respectful of the memory of his teacher Yoshida Shouyou due to his actions (the arrest of his teacher is one of the main reasons he joined the Joui War. The other was to protect his friends who also joined the war). When Jiraia called himself Tsukuyo's teacher and yet harmed her both emotionally and physically, his ideal for what a teacher was supposed to be resulted in Gintoki becoming enraged and taking his anger out on Jiraia.</p>

		<p>His inability to protect many of his friends in the Joui War still haunts him, especially the crushing guilt and regret that consumed him when the Tendoshu forced him to execute his own teacher in front of Takasugi and Katsura. As a result, he is very protective of his current friends and holds very little value to his own life. This carelessness can be seen in how Gintoki can plow through armies without tiring, apathetic to the serious injuries he sustains whilst cutting down his enemies. He told Kawakami Bansai, during the Shinsengumi Crisis Arc, that the only reason he fought in the Joui War was to protect his friends and not his country or the samurai way.</p>

		<p>The more comical stories depict Gintoki as a coward, attempting to leave behind many of his friends to save his own life. However, he is willing to risk his life for anyone and he is shown to be extremely caring towards his friends, and has killed Naraku members, terrorists and Amanto to protect them. He is extremely frightened of ghosts, but will usually deny their existence so that he doesn't look like a coward. His fear for the supernatural is shared by Hijikata and usually results in quite a few comic interactions between the two.</p>

		<p>He has many childish personality traits despite his age, and has even called himself a "child in a man's body." One such trait is his insatiable love for sweets, which has placed him at a risk of getting diabetes several times. His favorite food is chocolate parfait and he loves chugging down strawberry milk whenever he gets access to it.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Relationships</h2>
		<hr></hr>

		<img src="images/yoshida.jpg" alt="Yoshida Image" class="relationshipimage">
		<p><span style="color:yellow">Yoshida Shouyo</span> : Shouyou was probably the most important person in Gintoki's life, something that is further emphasized by Katsura who mentions that out of the three of them (Katsura, Takasugi and Gintoki), he should be the one to most hate the world considering what it did to Shouyou. Shouyou saved Gintoki from the endless battlefield and gave him the chance to act like a normal child. Gintoki deeply respects him to the extent that he gets furious if anyone dirties the name of being a master. The fact that he was forced to kill him to protect his comrades still haunts him and causes him an immense pain. Remembering his promise to Shouyou, to protect everyone, Gintoki and him shared one last smile with each other with Shouyou even thanking Gintoki before he decapitates him. Gintoki treasures deeply the lessons Shouyou taught him, despite the fact that he no longer has the things Shouyou gave him such as Shouyou's sword and the textbook, which he claims to have thrown away when he stained it with curry. This possibly means that he does not need material items to remember Shouyou and his lessons. One of the things Gintoki honors the most with his sensei is the promise they made the last time they saw each other. Although he controls himself, Gintoki has showed a dark side in which he wants to slay those who were related to the death of his beloved teacher, which is also shown by Takasugi and Katsura at the beginning of the series. During the Joui War when he, Katsura and Takasugi were captured by the Naraku, who were under orders of Sada Sada, Gintoki was forced to execute his beloved teacher in front of Takasugi and Katsura. During Nobu Nobu's reign when Matsudaira and Kondo were about to be executed in a similiar way to Shouyou, Gintoki decided to help the Shinsengumi save them so they won't make the same mistakes he did. Once he learned that Utsuro and Shouyou are the same person, but with different personalities from Nobume. A similar truth was told by Oboro to Takasugi and the later sent Takechi to Gintoki and Katsura to report about Shouyou and Utsuro true origin. Gintoki vows to avenge the good personality of his master and save the universe from Utsuro, even if it's master old temporary possessed body before Utsuro resurfaced to the real world again.</p>

		<img src="images/gintoki/kaguragintoki.png" alt="Kagura and Gintoki" class="relationshipimage">
		<p><span style="color:yellow">Kagura</span> : Gintoki cares about Kagura, especially when she's in danger or not in a good condition (he saved her in episode 42, when Kagura was attacked by an alien, despite the fact that he abandoned her during, and he even tried to skip his job to take Kagura to the hospital in episode 91). When she was feeling down because she didn't feel that her umbrella was as pretty as other girls, he ended up buying her a cute one (episode 111). Their relationship seems to be of a "father/daughter" or "husbands" kind since she greatly admires him and has even picked up several of Gintoki's bad habits, such as picking her nose. They are usually partners in crime and join together in many different gags.</p>

		<br></br>
		<img src="images/gintoki/shinpachigintoki.png" alt="Shinpachi and Gintoki" class="relationshipimage">
		<p><span style="color:yellow">Shimura Shinpachi</span> : Gintoki met Shinpachi at a restaurant where he had ordered a Chocolate Parfait when a fight broke out between Gintoki and some Amantos because they were harassing Shinpachi and accidentally spilled his Parfait. Since then, Shinpachi has been with Gintoki. Gintoki and Shinpachi share a close brotherly relationship, thought both are not willing to admit it (During the battle with Obi Hajime both men stated that neither of them see each other as brothers). Gintoki's bond with Shinpachi can be seen when he went as far as to get on his knees and beg for the Shinsengumi collaboration to keep Shinpachi safe during the Beam Sword Arc. It is also shown in the Kintama Arc that Gintoki was emotionally hurt when a hypnotised Shinpachi punched him and refused to acknowledge who he was. After the battle in the Harusame Arc, Gintoki finds an exhausted Kagura and Shinpachi who claimed to be too tired to walk home. Gintoki retorts on that by saying that he should be the most tired and leaves them be proceeding to walk off. However, he returns seconds later and carries them home. For a man who often doesn't show his soft side, he cares immensely for both Shinpachi and Kagura.</p>

		<br></br>
		<img src="images/gintoki/otose2.png" alt="Otose Image" class="relationshipimage"><br>
		<p><span style="color:yellow">Otose</span> : Otose is Gintoki's landlady and mother figure. They both met in a graveyard where Otose was visiting her husband's grave. There she gave food to a hungry and weak Gintoki and he vowed to protect her in her husband's place to show his gratitude. Although they argue about paying the rent, they both care about each other. When Otose was cut by Doromizu Jirochou, Gintoki went into a murderous rage against Jirochou, showing how much he cares about her.</p>

		<br></br>
		<img src="images/gintoki/katsuragintoki.png" alt="Katsura Image" class="relationshipimage">
		<p><span style="color:yellow">Katsura Kotarou</span> : Katsura has been Gintoki's friend ever since they were young. Gintoki was the one who founded Katsura's nickname, "Zura"("wig"), even though Katsura prefers his real name. They bicker with each other a lot and Gintoki often treats him as an annoyance, but they have complete trust in each other and are close friends. He has extreme faith in Katsura's strength and was extremely angry when Okada Nizou insulted Katsura by questioning whether he was really a man and stating that he had killed him. Although Katsura did witness Gintoki being forced to execute their teacher by the Naraku, during their capture in the Joui War, Katsura may have forgiven him as he feels Gintoki's regret for killing Shouyou with his own hand is a part of their teacher's sacrifice to save Katsura and his allies. In the present Katsura often hangs out with the Yorozuya and still entreats Gintoki to join his terrorist group.</p>

		<br></br>
		<img src="images/sakamoto2.png" alt="Sakamoto Image" class="relationshipimage"><br>
		<p><span style="color:yellow">Sakamoto Tatsuma</span> : Both of them fought in the Joui War and 'till this very day, Sakamoto has a close friendship with Gintoki even though he keeps calling him Kintoki. Gintoki admits that Sakamoto is extremely strong but states that his head is empty. When Sakamoto retired from the war he offered Gintoki to come along with him to explore the outer space, saying that a man like him was too good to stay on Earth, but Gintoki declined. </p>

		<br></br>
		<img src="images/kondou/kondo2.png" alt="Kondo Image" class="relationshipimage">
		<p><span style="color:yellow">Kondo Isao</span> : Gintoki has a lot of respect for Kondou after their first duel. Both of them also have the same desire to change Edo to become better and more peaceful, like Shige Shige. Although he wrote down a new Regulation that Yorozuya is to be hated, Kondo actually respects Gintoki, as Yamazaki stated in episode 32. It is noted that it was Gintoki himself who gave the latter the nickname "Gorilla" by judging Kondo's appearance. After Shige Shige's death and during Nobu Nobu's reign, when he and Matsudaira are about to be executed Gintoki is reminded that their fate is the same as his teacher. Just like the code of honour being passed on, the will of light to watch over Edo, his old Joui allies as well as Hijikata and his fellow former Shinsengumi rush to rescue them.</p>

		<br></br>
		<img src="images/hijikata/hijikata2.png" alt="Hijikata Image" class="relationshipimage">
		<p><span style="color:yellow">Hijikata Toushirou</span> : Hijikata and Gintoki share many of the same ideals: they both want to protect the people they care about and they will both throw away their own lives to protect the lives of others. They also have slightly similar personalities and are usually seen arguing or making snide comments about the other, which results in the two frequently clashing as rivals. They share many similar traits such as being afraid of ghosts and dentists, their obsession with certain types of food most people find disgusting and fiery tempers. However, they can reach an unbelievable synchronization when fighting together, as shown in the anime-only Episode 166, when the two defeated a large group of enemies before reinforcements arrived. Additionally, both share very similar thinking processes, as shown in Episode 48, where Hijikata and Gintoki attempt to avoid each other by trying to think like the other but end up together anyway because they were both trying so hard to avoid thinking like the other that they both ended up doing exactly the same. At one point, the two even switched souls in the Soul Switch Arc. However, even with all of the fights they have they are both shown to (extremely grudgingly) respect each other.</p>

		<p><span style="color:yellow">Okita Sougo</span> : Hijikata and Gintoki share many of the same ideals: they both want to protect the people they care about and they will both throw away their own lives to protect the lives of others. They also have slightly similar personalities and are usually seen arguing or making snide comments about the other, which results in the two frequently clashing as rivals.

		<br></br>
		<img src="images/gintoki/hasegawa2.png" alt="Hasegawa Image" class="relationshipimage"><br>
		<p><span style="color:yellow">Hasegawa Taizou</span> : Gintoki understands the misery of Hasegawa and has helped him many times. One time he even went to court as Hasegawa's defense attorney when Hasegawa was convicted for being a pervert. He won the trial, Hasegawa was released and all charges were dropped. He often joins Hasegawa in the pachinko parlor or for horse-betting. They seem to be good friends by doing everything they can to get money together.</p>

		<br></br>
		<img src="images/gintoki/takasugigintoki.png" alt="Takasugi Image" class="relationshipimage">
		<p><span style="color:yellow">Takasugi Shinsuke</span> : Although Gintoki and Takasugi studied together along with Katsura at Shoka Sonjuku under Yoshida Shouyou, the Kansei Purge tore them apart. Takasugi holds a deep hatred for Gintoki because he chose to execute Shoyo to save the lives of the students. Takasugi initially attempted to kill both Gintoki and Katsura with the help of his Kiheitai, and his rivalry with Gintoki peaks during the Shogun Assassination Arc, in which Takasugi aids in attempting to kill Shige Shige and ends up fighting Gintoki. After they brutally exhaust each other on open ground they reconcile and eventually join forces to fight against Utsuro.</p>
